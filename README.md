# 👋🏽 Hi, I'm Blandine

Software Development student based in Edmonton, Canada, with a background in medical laboratory science.

I’m transitioning into tech with a strong interest in working across the full stack, from frontend interactions to backend logic, using databases and Python to create applications that solve real problems.
## What I’m working on
- Building foundational projects using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and PostgreSQL
- Learning software development concepts through hands-on practice
- Exploring how thoughtful design and data modeling improve user experience

## Background
Before moving into tech, I worked in medical laboratory science, where accuracy, problem-solving, and structured thinking were essential.
These skills now inform how I approach software development and system design.
